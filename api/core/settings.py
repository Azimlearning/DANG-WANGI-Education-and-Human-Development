# Adapted from Azimlearning/Arcana-v2, api/core/settings.py @ 21c6dcf5. Read in full. Changes: the mode variable is
# SYNAPSE_LLM_MODE, embeddings are dropped (A-9), OpenRouter is an optional fallback (it is not required in live mode),
# and PUBLIC_ORIGIN is added because the sandbox CSP names it explicitly (hard constraint 2).
"""Typed settings from the process environment (the `.env` file; never the Environment artifact).

Every variable is documented in refdocs/guides/env_setup.md. Fakes are the default, so with SYNAPSE_LLM_MODE=fake no key
is needed and no network call is made. A live mode without its key or without a spend cap raises ConfigError at startup,
naming each missing variable.
