"""Cost estimates, in USD, used to enforce the monthly cap before a call is sent.

Prices are per million tokens (input, output), read from the provider's pricing page on 2026-10-16 (Opus 5.5 $4 and $20, Sonnet 5.5 $2 and
$10, Haiku 5.5 $0.10 and $0.50 up to 100,000 prompt tokens, Haiku 4.5 $1 and $5), and confirmed unchanged on 2026-10-18 (models overview and pricing
pages). Prompt caching is OFF by default (PROMPT_CACHING). The ledger knows its rates, so turning it on cannot under-count: a cache read is 5 percent of the base
input rate on Opus 5.5 and Sonnet 5.5 and 10 percent on Haiku 5.5, and a cache write costs 1.25 times the base rate (ASSUMED for the 5-minute cache: confirm it on the
pricing page, and the saving by one measured run, before relying on it). A model this table does not know is priced with no read discount. Before a call the cap
reserves the worst case, every input token as a write.
Re-check against the pricing page before a paid run. Estimates are deliberately conservative: input tokens are over-counted and output is assumed to run to
max_tokens. An unknown model is priced as the dearest one, so a typo can only over-reserve.
