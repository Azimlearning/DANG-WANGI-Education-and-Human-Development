# Synapse v4

> The UTP CodeFest '26 entry of Team Dang Wangi, Track 2, Education and Human Development. See [`CODEFEST.md`](CODEFEST.md).

Turn a Malaysian Form 4 or 5 KSSM science question into a verified, interactive **environment**: raw HTML/JS assembled over a vetted library of micro-components (65 so far, plus 26 apparatus parts), with the textbook evidence and an honest trust label beside it.

**Status:** in active development. The pipeline runs end to end on deterministic fakes and on the live model. A stored library of 31 labs across Physics, Biology and Chemistry answers known questions with no model call; with the owner's local textbook corpus loaded, each carries a citation the corpus re-proves word for word, and all 31 are `kit-verified`. Any other question gets a lab written for it, operated by drag and drop, and labelled for what it survived. Not done: no teacher has reviewed the labs, no learner study has run, and the latest prompt versions have no measured eval delta. See [`refdocs/STATUS.md`](refdocs/STATUS.md) for exactly what is and is not done.

## What it does

A student asks a science question. Synapse routes it, finds the textbook passages that state what it is about, and builds an environment: a bounded interactive world (a simulation, an experiment bench, a process explorer, an exam-practice room) where a verified model of the science responds to what they do.

Three lanes decide how it is made and what it is allowed to claim:

- **Instantiate:** a stored, re-verified environment, or a template filled in. Seconds, almost no cost.
- **Compose:** the model writes raw HTML/JS that calls the micro-component Kit. Every displayed number must come from an audited science micro-model. Labelled `kit-verified`.
- **Free:** the model writes the lab's text, drawing and script, and Synapse assembles them in the house page. Labelled `model-checked`, never `canonical` without human review, and logged as a Kit gap. If a full page is refused, a simpler lab is written, so every question ends with a lab.

Nothing unverified reaches the client: the deliverable type can only be minted by the verifier, and the delivery gate re-hashes it.

## Requirements

- Python 3.13 and [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv)
- Node 24 and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) 10
- Playwright browsers for the verification harness (installed in P0 task 6)
- No Docker and no database server: stores are SQLite

## Setup

```bash
uv sync
pnpm install
cp .env.example .env
```

Settings are documented in [`refdocs/guides/env_setup.md`](refdocs/guides/env_setup.md). With no key and `SYNAPSE_LLM_MODE=fake` (the default) everything runs on a deterministic fake model at no cost.

## Usage

```bash
uv run uvicorn api.main:app --reload --port 8000
pnpm --filter web dev          # http://localhost:3000
pnpm --filter kit build        # builds the micro-component Kit
```

**Do not expose the API publicly.** There is no auth, and the limits that exist are in-process and per worker; see ADR D-11 and the deploy gate in [`refdocs/guides/checklist.md`](refdocs/guides/checklist.md).

## Project layout

The short version; [`refdocs/guides/file_map.md`](refdocs/guides/file_map.md) says what each file is for.

```
api/                 FastAPI: pipeline, verify (the trust path), evidence, llm seam, routing, models
  prompts/           prompt packs, versioned files
web/                 Next.js: chat shell, sandbox host, shared links, progress
packages/
  schema/            wire types (TypeScript), codegen to Pydantic
  kit/               micro-components and science models, bundle, manifest
eval/                golden, hostile, planted-defect, census, cost, parity fuzzer, browser smoke
data/                plans, catalogue, taxonomy, router data, fixtures (no textbook text)
refdocs/             the doc system: PRD, STATUS, plans, execution, changelog, decisions, evidence
.claude/             agents, commands, preflight, hooks
```

The textbook corpus is never in the repository: point `CORPUS_DIR` at a local folder.
